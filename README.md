## Make Discord even darker!

This includes lot more black, so it's easier on the eye. After you have used Darkcord, you'll probably think that Discord's dark mode is light!

### How do I get a badge?

By contrubuting to this repo! When you do that:
* Make sure to not remove any content without proper explanation
* Don't give yourself vanity stuff, like badges
* Make sure you send a message to dante_nl#1234 to claim your badge. **YOU MUST HAVE LINKED YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT TO YOUR DISCORD ACCOUNT!**
