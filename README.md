# Darkcord

## Make Discord even darker!

This includes lot more black, so it's easier on the eye. After you have used Darkcord, you'll probably think that Discord's dark mode is light!

## Platforms

Darkcord is currently available for Powercord and GooseMod. Instructions are below:

### Powercord

It is as simple as opening the Terminal on macOS and Linux or the Command Prompt on Windows and pasting this command in there:
`cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/dante-nl/Darkcord`
When that is completed, reload your Powercord and check a plugin like [Theme Toggler](https://github.com/redstonekasi/theme-toggler) to enable it, if it's not already enabled.

### GooseMod

You have to go to the Discord Home page (the place where you have DMs and things), go to the "Themes" tab and search for Darkcord. Then you have to click "Install" and you're done!
